# The Cryptographic Transition

switches the fundamental algorithms that run our trust-based systems.

Our modern information society runs on rational and reasonable trust in upholding the following attributes of secure communications.

- __Confidentiality__: We communicate with each other and only we know what we communicated.
- __Authenticity__: We know who we communicate with.
- __Integrity__: What we received is what we sent each other.
- __Non-Repudiation__: We know who sent what.

Maintaining that trust [requires quantum-safe cryptography](rationale.html).

For cryptographic hash functions and symmetric cryptography you need sufficient hash and key sizes.

For asymmetric cryptography you need post-quantum cryptography like lattice- or hash-based algorithms.

For higher security you need hybrid cryptography, which uses both classic and post-quantum cryptography to gain the greater protection of both.

To uphold this level of security you need [cryptographic agility](agility.html).
