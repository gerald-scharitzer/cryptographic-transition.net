# The Cryptographic Transition

switches the fundamental algorithms that run our trust-based systems.

Our modern information society runs on rational and reasonable trust in upholding the following attributes of secure communications.

- __Confidentiality__: We communicate with each other and only we know what we communicated.
- __Authenticity__: We know who we communicate with.
- __Integrity__: What we received is what we sent each other.
- __Non-Repudiation__: We know who sent what.
