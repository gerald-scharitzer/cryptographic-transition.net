# Rationale

Our modern society relies on effective and efficient cryptography to enable trustworthy communication.

- Authenticity: We know who we talk to.
- Confidentiality: Only we know what we talked to each other.
- Integrity: What we said is what was heard.

Authenticity relies on public key cryptography to sign messages and verify signatures without sharing secrets.

Public key cryptography provides that.
